## 🚀 Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (version >= 20.0)
-   [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Installation

1.  Clone the repo
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/HuzaifaYousuf749//physical-ai-and-humanoid-robotics.git
    ```
2.  Navigate to the `docs` directory
    ```sh
    cd physical-ai-and-humanoid-robotics/docs
    ```
3.  Install YARN packages
    ```sh
    yarn
    ```

## 💻 Local Development

Run the development server:

```bash
yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server at `http://localhost:3000` and automatically opens it in your browser. Most changes are reflected live without needing to restart the server.

## 📦 Build

To generate a static build of the website:

```bash
yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory, which can be served using any static content hosting service.

This project is configured for easy deployment to GitHub Pages.

**Using SSH:**

```bash
USE_SSH=true yarn deploy
```

**Using a GIT_USER:**

```bash
GIT_USER=<Your GitHub username> yarn deploy
```

This command will build the site and push the contents of the `build` directory to the `gh-pages` branch of your repository.
